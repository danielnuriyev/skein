I would like you to do the following:
Delete test branch and .task folder.
Do all the following work in .task folder.
Log each step in .task/task.log
Create a branch named test.
The coding language should be Raku.
If the programming language is not available, you can download, install and configure it locally.
Do not install and configure it globally.
Create a function that finds the largest even number in a list.
Create tests.
Runs the tests.
If the code is wrong, fix it.
Create a readme describing the code and the test, how to run them.
Commit the work to the branch.
